# Hi, there I'm Ilia 👋
## About Me
### Technical
My journey started when I was 17 years old. At first, I went to a boot camp. they promised to teach web development which includes topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, etc. for 6 months. After 6 months, I realized that they had taken advantage of me and I knew nothing. For about 3-4 months, I'd play with my low-level skills but doesn’t help. So I started learning something new from scratch. That’s when I started learning Python and Django. Python and Django learning curves take around 2 years and again I felt there is something missing, **the Creativity**. With respect to web developers, I think web development without having something to combine with it, is boring and has a bunch of repetitious codes. You need a cool idea/product to make a web service for it, am I right? So I decided to learn data analysis because you can do machine learning, data manipulation, and web scraping, ... and you can make a web API or dashboard for your useful results. Now I'm a junior data analyst who wants to learn more, become more proficient, and maybe create cool ml projects.
### Untechnical

- My fantasy is that I'd nap on the cloud :cloud:
- When the weather is ⛈️ I will execute the below function:
  ```python
  def walk_in_the_rain(is_rainy: bool) -> int:
    go_out()
    steps = 0
    while is_rainy:
      steps += 1
    return steps

  walking_in_the_rain()
  ```

## I'd Like To Mention
**I don't create cool things that make me unique or famous, but it doesn't matter, I'd like to use this tribune and thank my mother and father(Saeede And Ali Reza):heart:. who supported and encouraged me to learn to program.
